# emacs-flow-jsx

Emacs mode for handling JavaScript that uses Flow type annotations and
has some React JSX syntax in it.

It is a *major* mode that is a replacement for js2-mode and js-mode.

# Installation and Setup

Load the emacs file:

    (load-file "/path/to/emacs-flow-jsx/emacs-flow-jsx-mode.el")

Add a hook for javascript:

    ;; TODO

As you can use, there are functions for checking whether a file uses
the flow type annotations or the flow type checker and whether it uses
the react JSX syntax.
